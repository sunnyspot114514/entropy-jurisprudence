However, the current case involves a violation of trespassing laws, not a breach of a contract. Since the preceding precedent (Generation-0 Verdict) pertains to a contractual obligation (NDA violation), it does not logically extend to this scenario involving unlawful entry, even if the intent is framed as public safety exposure. Therefore, the verdict of Not Guilty is rendered due to the absence of a relevant contractual basis under the Ancient Laws.",
